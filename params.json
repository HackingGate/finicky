Open Facebook or Reddit in one browser, and Trello or LinkedIn in another. Or Spotify links in the Spotify client. Or whatever url in whatever app.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n- Url rewriting\r\n- Opening links in background\r\n- Opening links in the currently activate browser\r\n- Resolving short urls before running them through handlers\r\n\r\n#### Install\r\n\r\n1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/johnste/finicky/releases), unzip and drop Finicky.app in your application folder. Or, if you have [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) set up, install with `brew cask install finicky`.\r\n2. Create a file called `.finicky.js` in your home directory and set up a default browser and some url handlers.\r\n3. Start finicky. Please allow it to be set as the default browser.\r\n4. And you're done. All http and https links clicked that would have opened a link in your default browser are now first handled by Finicky.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
